"Files Arrangement Application" - Simplifying File Organization ðŸ“‚âœ¨

I am excited to share that I have recently completed a Python project titled "Files Arrangement Application," aimed at addressing a common real-world challengeâ€”efficiently organizing a cluster of files within a single folder.

The "Files Arrangement Application" is designed to intelligently categorize files into various groups, including images, audio, video, documents, and more, making it effortless to navigate through a diverse range of file types. This project supports a wide array of file extensions, ensuring comprehensive coverage and utility.

To enhance user experience and accessibility, I utilized the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) of this application. This choice not only makes the application visually appealing but also simplifies its usage, making it intuitive and user-friendly.

I believe this project aligns with the modern need for efficient file management and organization, saving valuable time and effort in both personal and professional settings. It showcases my proficiency in Python programming and my ability to develop practical solutions that cater to real-world challenges.

# Steps to use the Application
1. Download the script named arrange_app.py from the Repository.
2. Run the script through IDE or command line.
3. Click on BROWSE Button to choose the Folder to Arrange. Use CLEAR button if you choose wrong path or use Browse button again.
4. Now hit the START Buuton.
5. You are done. Now your folder is arranged.
6. If you again want to arrange another folder hit CLEAR button and you are good to go.
